#RealAccount

RealAccount is a freeware Outlook add-in to specify account and signature at folder level. It adds a new folder properties tab, with ability to inherit parent's settings. This is a project I worked on from 2002 to 2004; tested with Outlook XP and 2003, it should work with Outlook 2010 too, don't know about more recent versions. Anyway, purpose is to show how add-in technology works in VB6. Binary package is available [here] (http://download.cnet.com/RealAccount/3000-2369_4-10319971.html).
